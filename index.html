        <p>I hope this finds you well,
        I don't really have much to say (syempre charot lang meron pa sa baba) but I am praying to God that you're in good health and good condition.
        I don't know the battles you are facing right now but I just want you to know that I am rooting and 
        supporting for your success.</p>

        <p>Maybe we aren't made for each other but I do really like you from afar and I don't express my feelings
            enough to you, I am afraid to hurt anyone, at first 
            I thought this was like a puppy love and eventually will go away but as the time passes, I felt that this
            was real and it took so long to say my feelings. 
            </p> <br>
            <p>I rarely get attached to a person and I was genuiely dumbfounded
            when I realized that I developed feelings to you and I can't show it and honestly I don't know why, I tried.
            there was something that you have that I don't clearly know 
            what it was for me to have these feelings for you. I am sorry, it's sad but it is what it is, I just 
            have to step forward without certain people.</p>

                I was supposed to write this as a letter pero panget sulat ko e. sorry na.
