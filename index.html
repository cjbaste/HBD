        <p>I hope this finds you well,
        I don't really have much to say but I am praying to God that you're in good health and condition.
        I know the battles you are facing right now and I just want you to know that I am rooting and 
        supporting for your success.</p>

        <p>Maybe we aren't made for each other but I do really like and love you from afar and I don't express my feelings
            enough to you, because of my past and I am afraid to broke my heart again and to hurt anybody, at first 
            I thought this was like a puppy love and eventually will go away but as the time passes by, I felt that this
            is real and it took so long to say my feelings. 
            </p> <br>
            <p>I rarely get attached to a person and I was genuiely dumbfounded
            when i realized that I developed feelings to you and can't show it to you and honestly I don't know why, others would say
            that I should confess instead of keeping it and I tried, there was something that you have that I don't clearly know 
            what it was for me to have these feelings for you. I am sorry if you read until this line, it's sad but sometimes you just 
            have to step forward without certain people.</p>
